# CS3650: Computer Systems
Section 03
Instructor: Nat Tuck


## Old computers

 - Mini-computers in the mid 70's.
 - Personal computers in the early 80's.

New thing: Multi-tasking

 - Problem: Shared resources

Solution: Add another program, the OS kernel

Programs have two ways to do stuff:

 - Execute machine instructions.
 - System calls

Computer system is a combination:

 - A specific Instruction Set Archetecture: AMD64
 - Operating System: Linux
 
Our target platform is: Linux on AMD64 (Debian 10)

# ISAs

 - Intel x86 / i386 / ia32
   - Modern version is AMD64 / x64 / x86_64 / Intel64
 - ARM (currently v7 or v8, has both 32 and 64 bit variants)
   - Common on phones. 

Less common stuff:

 - MIPS - Just like ARM, except it didn't win.
 - RISC-V
